	<h1>Mission Statement</h1>


	<p>At GLAM, we aim to empower women through our interactive
		financial literacy platform that is designed to educate, inspire, and
		equip women with the necessary financial knowledge to make informed
		decisions. Our platform not only makes learning personal finance fun
		and engaging but also empowers you to take control of your financial
		journey. You can easily track your spending, monitor your financial
		goals, and stay on top of your progress as you level up your money
		management skills. We believe that financial literacy is crucial
		because many young women lack the essential knowledge needed to make
		informed decisions about their own finances. Without strong financial
		literacy, it can easily lead to poor financial security and
		instability. GLAM aims to fill this gap by providing women with the
		tools, resources, and confidence to navigate their financial futures.
